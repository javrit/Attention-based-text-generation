This project is part of my specialisation in Machine Learning and Data Science at ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France. The notebook is a sort of course on generating text with attention-based neural network, especially for image captioning. It is supposed to be ~1h-1h30 long,
if you do the exercices. It's also a lot of reading and theory, which can be less entertaining... The last part of project invites you to train the model and use your own pictures that you might want to caption? Enjoy!

Many thanks to sgrvinod's github : [a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning), which was really helpful to write this course.
